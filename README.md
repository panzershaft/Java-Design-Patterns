## What are Design patterns ?

- Design patterns are solutions to a commonly recurring problem in software design.

- They are like blue-prints that you can use to customise a specific-solution to the recurring
  design problem you encountered. So that you dont re-invent the wheel.

- Design patterns are not boiler-plate codes that you just copy and paste, but they are
concepts which need to be understood and be crafted specifically for your design probem.
  
## Why to use them ?
- They have been tried and tested by experts, so you don't need to re-invent the wheel.
- Design patterns help in creating common design vocabulary between developers.

## Gang of Four Pattern Catalog
- The four authors of the famous book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
- In these booke the authors have discovered patterns emerging in their design solution while developing 
  software and cataloged them in the book.
  
## Classification of Patterns
- They have classified design-patterns into three categories:
    - **Creational patterns**: These patterns deal with the creation of new objects, and how they will 
      increase flexibility and re-usability of existing code.
    - **Structural patterns**: These patterns describe objects are connected to each-other, and how to
      keep the structures flexible and efficient.
    - **Behavioral patterns**: These patterns focus on hwo objects distribute work, and describe how each object
      does a single cohesive function.
